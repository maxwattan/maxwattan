### Hi, my name is Max. I am a fellow at Pursuit, which is a 12-month, Google-funded software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate whose graduates have been hired as developers at leading companies such as Pinterest, JP Morgan and Spotify.

Project-based curriculum provides hands-on experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, APIs, Git, Data Structures, Algorithms, sprints, Agile, code reviews, and pair programming. Outside of building javascript codes some of my hobbies include: cooking, baking, fishing, exercising and stretching.
